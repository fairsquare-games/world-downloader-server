# WorldDownloader Server

This repository contains a very super-duper simple server for uploading world files to. Right now,
it is pretty insecure and should probably not be used in production, but we don't really have much
time to create a better solution right now.

## Usage

The following scripts are available:
- `npm run dev` to start it up in development mode.
- `npm run build` to build the distribution bundle.
- `npm run start` to start the distribution bundle.
- `npm run build:start` to build the distribution bundle and start it.
